    Punjab (now in Pakistan). Raised in a family with a strong legacy of activism against British colonial rule, Bhagat Singh was
    deeply influenced by the struggles and sacrifices of his forefathers. He was a brilliant student with a fervent commitment to
    the cause of liberation, often immersing himself in revolutionary literature and political philosophy. His early exposure to the
    harsh realities of colonial oppression fueled his determination to seek radical changes in Indian society.

    Bhagat Singh is best known for his role in the revolutionary activities of the 1920s. His involvement in the Hindustan Socialist
    Republican Association (HSRA) marked a significant shift in his approach, from individual acts of resistance to organized 
    revolutionary efforts. One of his most notable actions was the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929, carried out with
    the intent to protest against repressive colonial laws and to draw attention to the cause of Indian independence. Although the 
    bombings were non-lethal, they resulted in Singh's arrest and widespread attention to his cause, elevating him to a national hero and
    symbol of resistance. played a pivotal role in shaping India's foreign policy and was one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned
    Movement.

    Singh's commitment to the struggle for freedom came at a great personal cost. Despite his young age, he displayed extraordinary 
    courage and dedication, which was evident in his hunger strike while imprisoned. Bhagat Singh and his associates, Rajguru and 
    Sukhdev, were sentenced to death for their involvement in the killing of John Saunders, a British police officer, which they 
    justified as an act of retribution against colonial injustice. On March 23, 1931, Bhagat Singh was executed at the age of 23, 
    leaving behind a legacy of bravery and sacrifice. His martyrdom inspired generations of Indians in their fight for independence and 
    solidified his place as a revered figure in the history of India's struggle for freedom.
